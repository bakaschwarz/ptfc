# ptfc

ptfc or PNG-to-FCNN-Converter is a software to help you classify images using simple Yes or No buttons or shortcuts and then converting
them into FCNN readable format.

In addition to that you can use [ptfc_fcnn](https://github.com/bakaschwarz/ptfc_fcnn) to train and test a neural network directly from
ptfc.

This software is of use if you intent to implement a network with a single output neuron that simply tells if a feature is in an image or not.
